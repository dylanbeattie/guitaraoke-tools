[Verse 1]
  D             A	        Bm             G
I only knew you for a while   I never saw your smile
            D
'til it was time to go
C            Em  G       A    D
Time to go away (time to go away)
                       A	     Bm                G
Sometimes it's hard to recognize   Love comes as a surprise
             D
And it's too late
     C                Em
It's just too late to stay
     G        A      
Too late to stay

        We`ll always be together    However far it seems (love never ends)
                   Bm	        Em      A      D    
We`ll always be together  Together in electric dreams

[Verse 2]
  D                    A	          Bm               G
Because the friendship that you gave  Has taught me to be brave
                  D             C              Em
No matter where I go I`ll never find a better prize
 G       A              D
(find a better prize)
                         A	     Bm             G                  D
Though you're miles and miles away I see you every day I don't have to try

  C             Em        G       A
I just close my eyes, I close my eyes
