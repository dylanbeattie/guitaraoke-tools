[Verse 1]
F                         Bb
Say you don't know me, or recognize my face
Eb                      C       F
Say you don't care who goes to that kind of place
F                        Bb
Knee deep in the hoopla, sinking in your fight
Eb        C        F                     C
Too many runaways   eating up the night

    Dm            Bb      C                               F     Bb
Mar-coni plays the mamba, listen to the radi-o, don't you remem-ber
   F          Bb    A  G         F          Bb       F    C    Dm

[Verse 2]
F                        Bb
Someone's always playing corporation games
Eb                        C        F
Who cares they're always changing   corporation names
F                           Bb
We just want to dance here, someone stole the stage
     Eb                C      F                       C
They call us irrespon-sible,   write us off the page

It's just another Sunday,                in a tired old street
Bb                   F           Bb         C    F    Bb   F      Bb       C    F
Police have got the choke hold,    oh-oh, oh,  oh,         but we just lost the  beat
 
[Verse 3]
F                    Bb
Who counts the money underneath the bar
Eb                      C        F
Who rides the wrecking ball  in-to our guitars
      F                         Bb
Don't tell us you need us, 'cos we're [the ship of] fools
Eb             C       F                              C
Looking for A-merica,  crawling through your schools
