Last night a little dancer came dancin' to my door
A                              G               E    D A
Last night a little angel came pumpin' cross my floor

She said "Come on baby I got a license for love
A                      G         E      D     A
And if it expires pray help from above! Because

In the midnight hour she cried "more, more, more"
A                             G            E    D A
With a rebel yell she cried- "more, more, more"

In the midnight hour babe- "more, more, more"
A                   G           E     D     A     Bm

A                                G             E  D A
But when I'm tired and lonely she sees me to bed
Bm
What set you free and brought you to be me babe
A                            G         E   D     A
What set you free I need you here by meâ€¦   Because
