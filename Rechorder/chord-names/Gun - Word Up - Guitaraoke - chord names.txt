F#                E
Yoh pretty ladies around the world
D                    E
Got a wierd thing to show you
        F#
So tell all the boys and girls
F#                                 E
Tell your brother, your sister and your mamma too
      D           E
We're about to go down
        F#
And you know just what to do
F#                              E
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
      D        E              F#
Glide past the people as they stop to look and stare
   F#                         E
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick oh mamma
D        E            F#
 Come on baby tell me what's the word
 
[Chorus]
       F#     E
Word up, everybody say
D                 E                 F#
When you hear the call you've gotta get it underway
       F#         E
Word up, it's the code word
   D                E          F#
No matter where you say it you know that you'll be heard
 
[Verse]
        F#               E  
Now you sucker DJ's that think you're fly
        D          E          F# 
There's gotta be a reason and you know the reason why
F# E 
Why you put on your airs and you act real cool
D E F# 
Got to realise that you're acting like fools
F# E
Now there's music we can use it you're free to dance
 D E F# 
We don't have the time for psychological romance
F# E  
No romance, no romance, no romance for me and mamma
D E F#
 Come on baby tell me what's the word
 
       F#     E
Word up, everybody say
D                 E                 F#
When you hear the call you've gotta get it underway
