 Am                                                G
 On the street where you girls talk about their social lives
                E                      F        G              Am       
They're made of lipstick, plastic, and paint, a touch of sable in your eyes.

Am                                                        G
All your life all you've ask is when your daddy's gonna talk to you
         E                 F                       Am
You were living in another world trying to get the message through.
E               G               Am
 No one heard a single word you said      
                Dm
 They should've seen it in your eyes 
          C                G
 What was going around her head.                                      
  Am                     G
    Ooooh she's a little runaway 
   C                     Em   G                   Am
    Daddy's girl learned fast all those things he couldn't say
   G      E                 Am  
    Ooooh    she's a little runaway.
Am                                           G   
  a different line every night guaranteed to blow your mind
E                   F        G             Am
 See you out in the streets, call me for a wild time
Am                                                G
  So you sit home alone cause there's nothing left that you can do
              E                    F                          Am
  There's only pictures hung in the shadows there for them to look at you
 E             G                                Am
  You know she likes the lights at night on the neon broadway sign
Dm                                 C                 G
  She don't really mind, it's only love she hopes to find                              
Am                     G
  Ooooh she's a little runaway 
 C                     Em   G                   Am
  Daddy's girl learned fast all those things he couldn't say
 G      E             Am  
  Ooooh    she's a little ruuuuuuuuunaway.
