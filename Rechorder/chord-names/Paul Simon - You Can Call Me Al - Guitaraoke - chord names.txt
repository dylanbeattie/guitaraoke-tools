a man walks down the street, he says why am I soft in the middle now,
F         C		     Bb               C
why am I soft in the middle, the rest of my life is so hard,
F          C		     Bb                   C
I need a photo-opportunity,  I want a shot at redemption,
F                      C           Bb          C
dont want to end up a cartoon, in a cartoon graveyard,

Bonedigger, bonedigger,	  dogs in the moonlight,

far away my well-lit door,

[Verse]
F            C		            Bb          C
a man walks down the street, he says why am I short of attention,
F            C		            Bb          C

wheres my wife and family,  what if I die here,

He ducked back down the alley with some roly-poly little bat-faced girl,
F            C		            Bb          C
All along, along  there were incidents and accidents,
F            C		            Bb          C
there were hints and allegations.

[Verse]
F            C		            Bb          C
a man walks down the street, its a street in a strange world,
F            C		            Bb          C
maybe its the Third World, maybe its his first time around,
F            C		            Bb          C
he doesnt speak the language, he holds no currency,
F            C		            Bb          C
he is a foreign man, he is surrounded by
F            C		            Bb          C
the sound, the sound,cattle in the marketplace,
F            C		            Bb          C
scatterlings and orphanages,
F            C		            Bb          C
he looks around, around, he sees angels in the architecture,
F            C		            Bb          C
spinning in infinity,  he says Amen and Hallelujah!

[Chorus]
F               C	 Bb              C    F    C    Bb C
If you'll be my bodyguard I can be your long lost pal,
F               C          Bb              C
I can call you Betty, and Betty when you call me
         F          C Bb C
you can call me Al.
