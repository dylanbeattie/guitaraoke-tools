Basket Case (Green Day)

[Verse 1]
 
E               B        C#m           G#m
Do you have the time  To listen to me whine
 A                E	           B
About nothing and everything   All at once
E           B	       C#m         G#m
I am one of those    Melodramatic fools
   A            E                    B
Neurotic to the bone  No doubt about it
 
[Chorus]
 
A             B             E
  Sometimes I give myself the creeps
A              B                  E
  Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
   A                B	   E         D        C#m
It all keeps adding up	 I think I'm cracking up
   A          B	                (E)
am I just paranoid?   am I just stoned?

[Verse 2]
 
  E         B	      C#m         G#m
I went to a shrink To analyze my dreams
    A                 E	                   B
She says it's lack of sex  That's bringing me down
  E         B	       C#m               G#m
I went to a whore   She said my life's a bore
   A               E	               B
So quit my whining cause It's bringing her down

[Chorus]
  
A             B             E
  Sometimes I give myself the creeps
A              B                  E
  Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
   A                B	   E         D        C#m
It all keeps adding up	 I think I'm cracking up
   A          B	                (E)
am I just paranoid?   am I just stoned?

[Bridge]
 
A              B
Grasping to control
NC         E
So I better hold on

  Sometimes I give myself the creeps
A              B                  E
  Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
   A                B	   E         D        C#m
It all keeps adding up	 I think I'm cracking up

am I just paranoid?   am I just stoned?
